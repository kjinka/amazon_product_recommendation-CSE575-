# product-recommend

Product recommendation is a highly-targeted approach which can generate high conversion rate and
make it very effective and smooth to do advertisements. Recommendation systems are typically
used by companies, especially e-commerce companies like Amazon.com, BestBuy, Snapdeal, Ebay
etc., to help users discover items they might not have found by themselves and promote sales to
potential customers. A good recommendation system can provide customers with the most relevant
products. This is a highly-targeted approach which can generate high conversion rate and make it
very effective and smooth to do advertisements. So the problem we are trying to solve here is that,
how to build effective recommendation systems that can predict products that customers like the
most and have the most potential to buy by using the ratings and reviews of several products
provided by several users in one of the e-commerce website Amazon.com, this recommendation
system can also be implemented to other websites. We used Ball tree algorithm and KNN algorithm, Logistic Regression
to propose top 3 recommendations based on three features namely user ratings, user reviews and
predicted ratings.
